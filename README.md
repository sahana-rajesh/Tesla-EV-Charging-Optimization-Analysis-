Tesla EV Charging Optimization Analysis

This project analyzes Tesla EV charging station usage data to identify high-demand locations, peak utilization periods, and infrastructure optimization opportunities. Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard to evaluate station performance, time-based charging behavior, and overall network utilization.

The analysis revealed that ~60% of total charging volume was concentrated in high-traffic locations, while peak hours accounted for ~40% of total sessions. These insights support data-driven recommendations for station expansion, load balancing, and improved charging accessibility.

Tools Used: Tableau, Excel/CSV (Data Cleaning & Preparation)
Key Focus Areas: Utilization Analysis, Time-Based Trends, Capacity Planning, Infrastructure Optimization
